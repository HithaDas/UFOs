# UFOs
Module 12 Challenge - Javascript

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

# Project Summary
My webpage displays UFO sightings that have been reported around the world. A webpage user can search for UFO sighting(s) by filtering on date, city, state, country, and shape.
The table displays results according to user input (changes in the filters). 

# Technologies used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap
Visual Studio Code
Google Chrome

# Recommendations
Some recommendations for future development include:

Creating and placing a "Clear" button in the "Filter Search" form as opposed to using the "UFO sightings".
Adding a drop-down menu in each filter to allow the user to select a choice within the menu.
