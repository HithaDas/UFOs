# UFOs
Module 12 Challenge - Javascript

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

# Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to build an easy to read and filter table using JavaScript. The table contains information about UFO sightings around the world, and can then be filtered to a specific Date, City, State, Country, or UFO shape.
The webpage is built from a HTML file. An app is created using JavaScript that will pull information on UFO sightings from a source file, display the data, and filter it as various parameters are entered.

# Recommendations
Some recommendations for future development include:

- Currently the filters will only accept lowercase value to correctly filter and is case-sensitive. For example, entering "benton" into the city filter will bring up a sighting that occured in Benton, CA. However, entering "Benton" will not bring up this sighting. 
There are a couple of ways we can fix this issue. We can add a note that reminds the user to enter their search criteria in all lowercase. Or we could update the code to look for close matches instead of an exact match. 

- Creating and placing a "Clear" button in the "Filter Search".

- Adding a drop-down menu in each filter to allow the user to select a choice within the menu.
